Democratically ruled Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, has complained of stepped-up military and political pressure from Beijing to force it to accept Chinese rule, 
including massed air force incursions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone.
The official People's 
Liberation Army Daily newspaper, 
in a brief report on its Weibo microblogging 
account, said the drills had been carried out                     "in recent days" in the southern part of 
Fujian province.
